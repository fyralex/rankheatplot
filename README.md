# rankheatplot
The rank-heat plot is a visual representation of the treatment hierarchy estimated in a network meta-analysis across multiple outcomes. Several ranking statistics can be displayed within a rank-heat plot, including the probability of being the best, mean/median ranking, and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA).
